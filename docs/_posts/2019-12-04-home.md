# Egloo

Egloo (formerly EglCore) is a simple and lightweight framework for OpenGL ES drawing and EGL management
in Android that uses object-oriented components - hence the name Egl**oo**. It can serve as a basis for 
complex drawing operations, but is mostly designed for helping in making common tasks simpler,
even for people that do not have any OpenGL experience.

Approaching OpenGL from Android can be hard because of the deep differences in the OpenGL API design
with respect to a typical object-oriented context. Egloo tries to take some of these difficulties away
by creating a **thin**, flexible layer of abstraction around EGL and GLES calls.

You can take a look at the demo app or see Egloo in action in more popular projects:

- in a zoomable Surface in the [ZoomLayout](https://github.com/natario1/ZoomLayout) library
- for transcoding videos in the [Transcoder](https://github.com/natario1/Transcoder) library
